	; This ROM is a collection of accuracy tests on an NROM cartridge.
	; NOTE: While most of these tests are universal to all revisions of the NES board, CPU, and PPU, there are a handful of tests that are not going to pass on all revisions.
	; To be more specific, these tests were designed for an RP2A03G APU/CPU, and an RP2C02G PPU.
	; Additionally, if you run this ROM on your console with a flash cart,You might fail some tests. Notably, the open bus tests fail on an Everdrive N8 Pro.
	
	; If you are looking for a specific test, consider CRTL + F searching for "TestPages:", as that's where the list of tests is.
	; The format for the tests as they are stored in the ROM is:
	; table "Name of test", $FF, Address_To_Store_Test_Results, Address_To_Jump_To_In_Order_To_Run_The_Test
	; so to easily find the code for a test,You can search for the "Address_To_Jump_To_In_Order_To_Run_The_Test:" routine for a given test.
	
	; NOTE: The NMI and IRQ vectors both point to RAM. This allows me to create tests that have different NMI/IRQ routines.

TEST_OpenBus:	
	;;; Test 1 [Open Bus]: Reading from open bus is not all zeroes. ;;;
	; Alright. What is "Open Bus"?
	; When reading from an address that isn't mapped to memory, the data pins are left "floating".
	; Let's learn about the data bus.
	; For instance, imagine LDA <$00. This is a 3 cycle instruction.
	; 1. Fetch the opcode:
	;	- The value of the PC is transferred to the Address Bus, and that address is read. The PC is also incremented.
	;	- When reading from memory, the value that gets read is placed on the data bus, which carries the 8-bit value to the CPU.
	;	- So in this example of LDA <$00, the value read is $A5, so the data bus holds $A5.
	; 2. Fetch the operand:
	;	- The value of the PC is transferred to the Address Bus, and that address is read. The PC is also incremented.
	;	- In this case, the value read is $00, which sets up the address bus for the third cycle of the LDA zeroPage instruction.
	; 3. Read from target address:
	;	- Read the value determined by the address bus. (in this case, that's address $0000)
	;	- The value at address $0000 is put on the data bus, and the CPU takes this value and overwrites the value of the A Register.
	;	
	; Great! So that's how the data bus works. But what happens if you read from somewhere not mapped to anything?
	; Let's see how LDA $5000 works. This has 4 cycles.
	; 1. Fetch the opcode: (The data bus now holds $AD)
	; 2. Fetch the first operand: (The data bus now holds $00)
	; 3. Fetch the second operand: (The data bus now holds $50)
	; 4. Read from target address:
	;	- Since there's nothing mapped to address $5000, the data bus is left floating, and nothing changes.
	;	- Since the value of the data bus is unchanged, it still holds the value $50, which was set during the third cycle.
	;
	; And that's how open bus works!
	; Open bus is typically from $4000 to $7FFF. (Except for addresses $4015 (APU_STATUS), $4016 (Controller port 1), and $4017 (Controller port 2)
	; If the cartridge has "PRG RAM", which is typically from $6000 to $7FFF, then those addresses wouldn't be open bus since they are mapped to something.
	; This cartridge doesn't have any PRG RAM, but I'm only going to test from the $4018 to $5FFF range.
	; Most emulators assume that (unless specified) the cartridge has PRG RAM from $6000 to $7FFF.
	;
	; This test only checks for open bus from $4020 through $5FFF. 
	; Though I think it should be implied that $6000 through $7FFF should be open bus as well, the iNES format implies 8 KiB of PRG RAM at $6000–$7FFF
	; Therefore this ROM needs to be NES 2.0 just to guarantee the open bus there, assuming the emulator is NES 2.0 compliant.
	;
	; anyway, some emulators might just assume reading from this range always returns 00, which is incorrect. Let's test for that!

	; Here is what is expected to run in open bus:
	; LSR <$56,X
	; RTS
	;
	; Here's what could go wrong:
	; Open bus behavior could be faked, specifically by always returning the high byte from this address range.
	; in which case, `LSR <$56,X` will run until $5700, running `SRE <$57,X` until $5800, running `CLI` until $5900, and so on.
	; In that case, once the PC reaches $6000, it will run RTS, however the flags and stuff will be wrong, so we can check for that.
	;	-In theory we already ruled this behavior out with previous tests... but who knows. A lot could go wrong with emulation.
	;
	; It's also possible the same thing will happen, but instead of RTS, it runs BRK. Either way, that's a fail.
	; Since that's a possibility, set up the IRQ routine.
	;
	; It's also possible the JSR instruction does things out of order, leaving the wrong value on the data bus. I can't really predict what will happen then, but just so we're clear:

	; A lot of these unofficial instruction tests will tell you to "see TEST_SLO" for an explanation. Here it is!
	
	; First of all, the test happens in RAM around address $580.
	; The instruction we are testing for begins at address $593.
	; If your emulator has some debug tools, (Or if it doesn't,Your IDE probably does...) consider setting a breakpoint when the program counter is at address $593.
	;	
	; The ASM code in this section might look a little confusing...
	; These JSR instructions lead to subroutines that modify the return address
	; so the .DW and .DB parts don't get executed.
	; The format of these tests look like this:	
	;
	; JSR TEST_RunTest_AddrInitAXYF
	; iAddress
	; iValue 
	; iA,   iX,   iY,   iflags
	; rAddress
	; rValue 
	; rA,   rX,   rY,   rflags
	;
	; The address at "iAddress" will be assigned the value of "iValue". 
	; The A register will be assigned the value of iA, the X register will be assigned the value of iX, and so on.
	; Then the test runs, which is pretty much just running the instruction in question. In this case, it's some form of SLO.
	; Then, the value of rAddress is compared with rValue. (If it doesn't match, return error code 1)
	; Then, the value of the A register is compared with rA. (If it doesn't match, return error code 2)
	; Then, the value of the X register is compared with rX. (If it doesn't match, return error code 3)
	; Then, the value of the Y register is compared with rY. (If it doesn't match, return error code 4)
	; Then, the value of the status flags are compared with rflags. (If they don't match, return error code 5)

	; Let's walk through this one for the sake of documentation.
	; $0500 = $40, A = $01
	; SLO will shift the value at $0500 to the left.
	; $40 << 1 = $80, so that's the new value at $0500
	; then, bitwise OR the A register with the result of that previous step.
	; $01 | $80 = $81.
	; So the result is, $0500 = $80, and A = $81.
	; The Negative, Carry, and Zero are the only flags modified, and they behave like ORA in this instance.
	; So in this case, the negative flag is set, carry is cleared, and zero is cleared.

	;;; Test 2 [Arbitrary Sprite Zero]: The first processed sprite of a scanline is treated as "sprite zero". ;;;
	; This test is a bit tricky to understand. Let's break down the sprite evaluation process by which ppu cycles in a scanline are doing which task.
	; PPU cycle >= 1 && PPU cycle <= 64: clear Secondary-OAM.
	; PPU cycle >= 65 && PPU cycle <= 256: Sprite evaluation
	; PPU cycle >= 257 && PPU cycle <= 320: Shift register initialization. (Every one of these cycles also clears PPUOAMAddress to 0.)
	;
	; Keep in mind, on scanline n, we're processing the OAM data in preparation for scanline n+1.
	; (So the sprites drawn on, for example, scanline 6 were evaluated during the rendering of scanline 5.)
	;
	; Let's take a deep look into how Sprite Evaluation works on any given scanline. (PPU cycle >= 65 && PPU cycle <= 256)
	; for odd ppu cycles: read index "PPUOAMAddress" of OAM. Let's call the value read "S"
	;	- "PPUOAMAddress" is the value set by writing to $2003.
	;	- for our example here, assume PPUOAMAddress is zero, reset during the shift register initialization from the previous scanline.
	; for even cycles: Evaluate "S" and determine if this sprite should be drawn on the next scanline.
	;	- Depending on how the evaluation goes, modify PPUOAMAddress. Typically increment by 1 or 4. (actually "it's complicated", but that's for a different test.)
	; Let's focus on the even cycles.
	; First of all, if Secondary-OAM is full, the behavior is different. Let's focus on when Secondary-OAM is not full.
	; STEP 1: Check that the Y position of this object is in range of this scanline.
	;	- The value checked here is "S", which was read in the previous PPU cycle. In this example, "S" should be index 0 of OAM, since PPUOAMAddress was cleared in the previous scanline.
	;	- If the current scanline number-"S" is positive, and less than 8 (or 16 if the sprites are using the 8 by 16 mode) then this object is in range for this scanline.
	;	- That previous sentence was just a verbose way of calculating "yes, this object should be rendered on the next scanline".
	;	- Now, if Secondary-OAM is not full (in this example it is still empty, so yeah- it's not full) we know this object will be in the next scanline, so add it to Secondary-OAM.
	;	- In addition to being added to Secondary-OAM, if this is PPU cycle 66 of a scanline, it is assumed that we are processing sprite zero, so raise a flag indicating sprite zero exists on the next scanline.
	; STEP 2 to 4: Read "S" as the CHR data, attributes, and X position respectively. (each of these steps happen 2 ppu cycles after the previous step, since we need to read "S" from OAM again)
	;	- There's actually some wild stuff going on with the X position, but that's for a different test.
	;
	; So to recap, read the Y position, and on the following cycle, see if it's in range. If it is, and this is PPU cycle 66 of a given scanline, raise a flag indicating sprite zero exists on the next scanline.
	; - this "flag" essentially says, Secondary-OAM index 0 is "Sprite Zero", as in, a Sprite Zero hit will occur if a "solid pixel" of "sprite zero" overlaps a "solid pixel" of the background.
	; - which is, again, a really verbose way of saying "run a check for a sprite zero hit next scanline" if the value of "S" on ppu cycle 66 was in range for this scanline. 
	;
	; Duh. If you've implemented sprite zero hits,You should be following along. 
	; Perhaps that "flag" isn't the exact way your emulator checks if a sprite is "sprite zero", but it will make sense in a moment why I'm phrasing it this way.
	;
	; What happens if you write to $2003 after the "Shift register initialization" and before "Sprite evaluation"?
	; Well, PPUOAMAddress won't be $00 when sprite evaluation begins.
	; So the first sprite processed on cycle 66 won't necessarily be index zero of OAM.
	; But if "S" is in range of the scanline, and it's cycle 66, then the next scanline will consider Secondary-OAM index 0 as "sprite zero", even if it isn't OAM index 0.
	;
	; In other words, it *is* possible for an object that isn't OAM index 0 to trigger a sprite 0 hit!

	; On a completely unrelated topic, writing to $2003 is all sorts of jank, and I need my test here to prevent that "jankiness" from ruining the results.
	; This behavior appears to only happen on CPU/PPU clock alignment 3:
	; writing to $2003 can copy 8 bytes of OAM from $20 to $27, and paste these values at:
	; The old PPUOAMAddress & $F8
	; The new PPUOAMAddress & $F8
	; So we also want to the 8 values starting at $20 to match the 8 values we want at the new PPUOAMAddress

	; Since this test is a doozy, I will comment every line and explain why I'm doing this.

	;;; Test 2 [Misaligned OAM Behavior]: Misaligned OAM "+4 behavior" Offset by 1" ;;;	
	; Misaligned OAM should stay misaligned until an object's Y position is out of the range of this scanline, at which point the OAM address is incremented by 4 and bitwise ANDed with $FC.
	
	; In the "Arbitrary Sprite Zero" test, I said the following:
	; 	- Depending on how the evaluation goes, modify PPUOAMAddress. Typically increment by 1 or 4. (actually "it's complicated", but that's for a different test.)
	; Well, it's time for that test! 
	; When evaluating if the Y position of an object is in range for the scanline, if it *isn't* in range, the following occurs.
	; PPUOAMAddress += 4
	; PPUOAMAddress &= $FC
	;
	; This bitwise AND masks away the lower 2 bits, and it's not super common to see emulated.
	; If OAM is always aligned, then this bitwise AND seemingly does nothing.
	; In pretty much every case, the OAM address will always be a multiple of 4 when reading the Y position from OAM. 
	; Hence, adding 4 to this address when an object's Y position is not in range would take it to another multiple of 4. The bitwise AND makes no affect.
	;
	; However, if the OAM address is not a multiple of 4 when this bitwise AND occurs, it will re-align the PPUOAMAddress with a multiple of 4.
	; Let's study a series of bytes in OAM and how this works.
	; I'll put square brackets around the first object to be evaluated, and curly braces around the second. 
	; Try visualizing it like a Venn diagram: [A {B] C} where "A" are bytes exclusive to the first object, "B" are bytes that are shared, and "C" are bytes exclusive to the following object to get processed.
	; If OAM is aligned, it might look like this:
	; (OAM Address $80): [$80, $FC, $00, $08,] {$00, $FC, $00, $08}
	; Where that first byte ($80) is not in range of the scanline, so PPUOAMAddress is incremented by 4 and bitwise ANDed with $FC. The result takes PPUOAMAddress to $84.
	; This is the expected behavior, but when OAM is misaligned, these objects "overlap", sharing bytes. What would have been the X position of the first object becomes the Y position of the second:
	; If OAM is misaligned +1, it might look like this.
	; (OAM Address $80): $FF, [$80, $FC, $00, {$08,] $00, $FC, $00,} $08
	; Where that first byte ($80) is not in range of the scanline. The result still takes PPUOAMAddress to $84 (where the value is $08), due to the bitwise AND.
	; If OAM is misaligned +2, it might look like this.
	; (OAM Address $80): $FF, $FF, [$80, $FC, {$00, $08,] $00, $FC,} $00, $08
	; Where the same thing applies. PPUOAMAddress is now $84.
	; If OAM is misaligned +3, it might look like this.
	; (OAM Address $80): $FF, $FF, $FF, [$80, {$FC, $00, $08,] $00,} $FC, $00, $08
	; Where the same thing applies. PPUOAMAddress is now $84.
	; And if OAM is misaligned +4, then it's actually aligned again.
	; (OAM Address $80): $FF, $FF, $FF, $FF, [$80, $FC, $00, $08,] {$00, $FC, $00, $08}

	; So to recap, if the Y position *is* in range, then PPUOAMAddress is incremented by 1. Otherwise, add 4 to PPUOAMAddress, and mask away the lower 2 bits of PPUOAMAddress.
	; This results in OAM becoming "re-aligned".
	; And we can test for this behavior by misaligning OAM, having it get re-aligned, and then putting 9 objects on a single scanline to set the Sprite Overflow flag.
	; If the behavior does not match the console, then the data processed will intentionally be set up such that the sprite overflow flag doesn't get set.
	
	; To assist in debugging, the sprite evaluation for all of these tests will occur on scanline 0, and will be the first objects evaluated, starting at dot 65.
	
	; So to recap in simpler terms,
	; If the value read as the Y position *is* in range, just add 1 to the OAM address.
	; If the value read as the Y position is *not* in range, just add 4 to the OAM address and bitwise AND the OAM address with $FC.

	; In the "Arbitrary Sprite Zero" test, I said the following:
	;	- There's actually some wild stuff going on with the X position, but that's for a different test.
	; Now it's time to test for this!
	; When evaluating the X position of an object, it also makes the same "in range of scanline" calculation that the Y position makes.
	; It's a bit confusing to explain, so let me recap.
	; In the "Arbitrary Sprite Zero" test, I specifically stated:
	; 	- for odd ppu cycles: read index "PPUOAMAddress" of OAM. Let's call the value read "S"...
	;	- for even cycles: Evaluate "S"...
	;	- STEP 1: Check that the Y position of this object is in range of this scanline.
	;		- If the current scanline number-"S" is positive, and less than 8 (or 16 if the sprites are using the 8 by 16 mode) then this object is in range for this scanline.
	;	- STEP 2 to 4: Read "S" as the CHR data, attributes, and X position respectively. 
	;
	; The exact same calculation used in "STEP 1" to determine if a value is in range of the scanline happens again in STEP 4.
	; Except now "S" holds the value of the X position.
	; So, if the current scanline number-"S" is positive, and less than 8 (or 16 if the sprites are using the 8 by 16 mode) then this object is in range for this scanline.
	; In the case of the Y position not being in range,You would add 4 to PPUOAMAddress and bitwise AND PPUOAMAddress with $FC.
	; However, in the case of the X position not being in range,You only add 1 to PPUOAMAddress, though you still bitwise AND with $FC.
	; In aligned OAM, this bitwise AND is never noticed, as adding 1 will align the PPUOAMAddress.
	; With misaligned OAM, we can detect this, again, by putting 9 objects on a scanline.

	;;; Test 3 [APU Register Activation]: Can the DMA read from the APU registers when the CPU is not executing out of page $40? ;;;	
	; What's happening here?
	; The 2A03 chip (the CPU/APU) has an address bus.
	; Inside the 2A03 chip are 3 address buses: The 6502 Address Bus, the DMC Address Bus, and the OAM Address bus. On any given cycle, only one of these buses can be chosen to connect to the 2A03 address bus.
	; Here's the catch. Reading from the APU registers requires the 6502 address bus to be in the range of $4000 through $401F.
	; If the OAM address bus is pointing to $4000 through $401F, and the 6502 address bus isn't, then the OAM DMA will only read open bus from that range.
	; Which can be detected, since reading $4015 clears the interrupt flag.
	;
	; This test will write $40 to $4014, running an OAM DMA that will read from address $4000 to $40FF.
	; However, the APU registers are not active! So every value read by the DMA will be open bus.

	;;; Test 4 [APU Register Activation]: Can your emulator handle the wacky setup required to determine if the APU registers are active due to the 6502 address bus? (this could cause a crash) ;;;
	; Oh- also don't press anything on controller 2 during this test. thanks. :)
	;
	; Okay, so what is this test all about?
	; The APU registers (from $4000 to $4017) are not always accessible.
	; For instance, in the previous test, the APU registers were not active, so that OAM DMA didn't read any of the value there.
	; So "What activates the APU registers?" I hear you asking.
	; These registers are active when the 6502 Address Bus is in the range $4000 through $401F.
	; So if the 6502 address bus was within that range, and a OAM DMA were to occur, then the OAM DMA would be able to read the APU registers.
	;
	; Here's the plan. (Special thanks to lidnariq and Fiskbit)
	; Execute STA $4014 (A = $40) from address $3FFE. (The 6502 address bus will be $4001 when the OAM DMA occurs. Follow that up with a BRK from address $4001.)
	; In order to make this work, we need the PPU data bus to be $8D, the PPU Buffer to be $14, and Open Bus to be $40
	; So, the order of operations here is: 
	; Prepare PPU buffer with $14. (some writes to $2006, a write to $2007, more writes to $2006, and a read from $2007)
	; Prepare PPU data bus with $8D. Write $8D to $2002.
	; Now, when we execute this:
	; [$3FFE = $8D] [$3FFF = $14] [DMC DMA! Overwrite data bus with $40] [$4000 = $40] [OAM DMA!]
	; Which will result in an OAM DMA where the 6502 Data bus is in-fact from the range $4000 to $401F, so the OAM DMA *will* read from all the registers.
	; And then the final value of the data bus will be $00, so the following instruction will be BRK.
	;
	; We'll also want to set up one of the audio channels to be playing, so the results are slightly more interesting. (so APU STATUS has a value other than $00) How about the triangle channel?
	;
	; Okay, but what's actually happening during the DMA? 
	;
	; The only registers at play here are $4015, $4016, and $4017, since those are the only readable APU registers.
	; However, since the APU registers are active (the 6502 address bus is within $4000 through $401F) the OAM DMA can read from the APU registers.
	; Surprisingly, these registers have mirrors every $20 bytes. They just aren't normally accessible, as the 6502 address bus would typically be out of the $4000 through $401F range when trying to read these mirrors.
	; However, with the APU registers active, the OAM DMA will be able to read from the APU registers and their mirrors.
	; Here's the values that are expected to be put in OAM by this DMA.

TEST_IFlagLatency:
	; How this works.
	; The IRQ occurs when the CPU polls for interrupts, the "IRQ Level Detector" is low, and the I flag of the CPU is not set.
	; As an emulator developer, this poses 2 questions. What sets the IRQ Level Detector low, and when does the CPU poll for interrupts?
	; In an NROM cartridge, there are 2 ways the IRQ Level Detector is set low:
	;	- If the DMC DMA's IRQ flag is set and the final byte of a DMC sample finishes playing. (this is the method used for this test)
	;	- If the APU's frame counter IRQ is enabled, and the frame counter reaches the end of its sequence in mode 0.
	; If the level detector is left low, an IRQ will happen again if the I flag is disabled. (The interrupt sets the I flag. Otherwise it would be an infinite slide of interrupts)
	; The only way the IRQ Level Detector is set high again is by "acknowledging the IRQ".
	; With the DMC DMA IRQ method, we acknowledge the IRQ by writing to $4010 to disable the IRQ.
	;
	; To understand the timing of IRQ Level Detector, We need to talk about a CPU cycle in even more depth.
	; The clock line of the 6502 (called φ0) is used to form two separate clock inputs. "φ1" is raised when φ0 is low. "φ2" is raised when φ0 is high.
	; You can imagine a CPU cycle in 2 halves. φ1 and φ2.
	;    ......:...........:...........:...........:...........:...........:...........:......
	;    ┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐     
	; φ0 │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │  
	;    └─────┘     └─────┘     └─────┘     └─────┘     └─────┘     └─────┘     └─────┘     └
	;    [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  [φ1]  [φ2]  
	; During φ2 of each CPU cycle, (The timing of this is important when it comes to CPU/PPU Clock alignments, since the PPU is clocked 3 times as often as the CPU clock), the IRQ Level Detector is connected to the IRQ line of the 6502.
	; 
	; Finally, let's talk about "interrupt polling"
	; Just because the IRQ line is set (and the I flag is not), that doesn't mean an IRQ will happen on the next CPU cycle.
	; The CPU needs to poll for interrupts, and this happens (typically*) before the final CPU cycle of an instruction. If an interrupt was detected, then the following instruction will be an interrupt. (This also applies to the NMI)
	; *A branch that isn't taken only polls once before the second cycle, while a branch that is taken additionally polls right before the fourth cycle. (in total, 2 polls.)
	;	- This means that a branch that doesn't cross a page boundary will have the "interrupt delay". See the breakdown below.
	;	- BRK seems to poll before cycle 2, 3, 4, and 5, notably not polling before cycles 6 and 7. This might be the cause of "Interrupt Hijacking"?
	;
	; And this process of polling is directly the cause for the latency in clearing the interrupt flag. Here are the order of operations:
	;	- Assume the I flag is set. (Interrupts will not occur until cleared)
	;	- The IRQ Level Detector is pulled low.
	;	- on φ2, this is detected, and the IRQ pin of the 6502 is set.
	;	- a CLI instruction runs:
	;		- Cycle 1: read the opcode, $58. (An interrupt did not occur, so we keep it)
	;		- Interrupt polling: The I flag is set, so the interrupt does not occur.
	;		- Cycle 2, dummy read, and then clear the I flag.
	;	- The next instruction occurs. Let's say it's a NOP.
	;		- Cycle 1: read the opcode, $EA. (An interrupt did not occur, so we keep it)
	;		- Interrupt polling: The I flag is not set, so the interrupt does occur!!!
	;		- Cycle 2: dummy read.
	;	- The next instruction occurs, but now we're running an interrupt!
	;
	; And you can follow this logic to see why the RTI instruction can update the I flag and be followed by another interrupt immediately:
	;	- Assume the I flag is set. (Interrupts will not occur until cleared)
	;	- The IRQ Level Detector is pulled low.
	;	- on φ2, this is detected, and the IRQ pin of the 6502 is set.
	;	- an RTI instruction runs:
	;		- Cycle 1: read the opcode, $40. (An interrupt did not occur, so we keep it)
	;		- Cycle 2: Dummy read
	;		- Cycle 3: Dummy read at the stack pointer
	;		- Cycle 4: Read from the stack, and copy the values to the processor flags. (Updates the I flag) Also increment the address bus low byte.
	;		- Cycle 5: Read from the stack, this value is held in the data latch. Also increment the address bus low byte.
	;		- Interrupt polling: The I flag is not set, so the interrupt does occur!!!
	;		- Cycle 6: Update the low byte of the PC, Read from the stack, update the high byte of the PC, and copy the low byte of the address bus into the stack pointer.
	;	- The next instruction occurs, but now we're running an interrupt, since the I flag was updated before polling!
	;
	; Let's also walk through that example with the branches, since I'll be testing for it.
	;	- Assume the I flag is clear. (Interrupts will occur)
	;	- Assume The IRQ Level Detector is pulled high. (It will be pulled low mid-instruction for this example)
	;	- The Z flag is set.
	;	- A BEQ instruction runs:
	;		- Cycle 1: read the opcode, $F0. (An interrupt did not occur, so we keep it)
	;		- Interrupt polling: The IRQ line is not set, so the interrupt does not occur.
	;		- It's time for φ2, and let's say that this was timed such that the IRQ Level Detector went low just in time for this cycle, so the IRQ line is now set.
	;		- Cycle 2: Read the operand, check the value of the Z Flag. It is set, so the instruction isn't over yet.
	;		- Cycle 3: Dummy read, move the PC according to the value read in the operand. Let's say the page boundary was not crossed. (End of instruction)
	;	- Welp, the interrupts were not polled after the IRQ line was set, so the interrupt won't occur until after the next instruction.
	;
	; And by extension,You can follow this logic for the following instructions:
	; 	- SEI: Polls happen before the I flag is set.
	;	- PLP: Polls happen before the I flag is pulled off the stack.	
	;
	; And the test works by simply running an instruction that updates the I flag, running an INX, then the IRQ should run, storing X somewhere. We can see how long the delay was by measuring the value we stored.

	; If you are reading this, then you probably passed test 6 and failed test 7.
	; This was a brand new discovery as of writing this ROM, so I expect most emulators to fail this.
	;
	; When reading from $4015, bit 6 will be cleared. This is known behavior (and the focus of test 5)
	; However, bit 6 will not be cleared until the next "get" cycle.
	; For instance here's what happened during test 6:
	; (get) [Read Opcode: $1F]
	; (put) [Read Operand: $15]
	; (get) [Read Operand: $40]
	; (put) [Read $4015] (this is a get cycle, so clear bit 6 of 4015)
	; (get) [Read $4015] (bit 6 was already cleared before the read.)
	;
	; And here's what will happen in this test:
	; (put) [Read Opcode: $1F]
	; (get) [Read Operand: $15]
	; (put) [Read Operand: $40]
	; (get) [Read $4015] (this is a put cycle, so bit 6 of 4015 will not be cleared until after the next cycle.)
	; (put) [Read $4015] (bit 6 was still set when this was read. *Now* we clear bit 6 of $4015.)
	;
	; And of course, in the event of a regular non-double-read, $4015 will still only clear bit 6 on the next get cycle,
	; so you probably want to clear bit 6 inside the APU cycle code of your emulator, and not in your "read $4015" code.
	; I suggest making a flag for "we are clearing bit 6 on the next APU get cycle" to be set inside the "read $4015" code.

	;;; Test L [APU Delta Modulation Channel]: Check that the DMA will be delayed by 1 CPU cycle if the write to $4015 (which enables the DMC) occurs 2 cycles before the DMA timer reaches 0. ;;;
	; Keep in mind, at the moment we're writing $10 to $4015, the DMC sample still has 1 bit remaining before the buffer is cleared.
	; Which poses an interesting question. Do we run a load DMA (because we wrote to $4015), or a reload DMA (because the last bit in the buffer has been read)? 
	; So the order of operations is: 
	; - Write $10 to the $4015. The Delta Modulation Channel will be enabled in 3 CPU cycles.
	; - Timer reaches zero, and the last bit in the buffer has been read, attempt to run a DMC DMA on the next CPU cycle.
	; - We're ready for the DMA, but the Delta Modulation Channel isn't enabled yet! Wait another cycle.
	; - The DMC is enabled this time, so the DMA occurs.
	;
	; Per my current understanding, if a sample is playing,You disable the DMC, and the final bit is read from the buffer, the DMA will still attempt to run every cycle until the DMC is re-enabled.

TEST_DMABusConflict:
	; A very similar test to [APU Register Activation]. In fact, I highly suggest you pass that test before looking into this one, as it's slightly more complicated.
	; As a recap, when the 6502 address bus is in the range $4000 to $401F, the APU registers are active (including mirrors of them.)
	; Except the registers aren't just active from $4000 to $40FF. They are active everywhere. Every $20 bytes across the entire address space will be mirrors of the APU registers.
	; Luckily, only 3 of the APU registers have readable values, and the rest are just open bus.
	; So when the 6502 address bus is in the range $4000 to $401F, a DMC DMA reading a sample at address, for example, $FF16 will encounter a bus conflict with controller port 1!
	; The bus conflict is works like this:
	;	- Bits 5, 6, and 7 of the controller port are typically open bus, but in this instance, those 3 bits will be bits 5, 6, and 7 of the sample value read by the DMA, while the rest of the bits are a standard controller read.
	; 	- You could easily emulate this as two lines:
	; 		- Read(CurrentSampleAddress); 
	; 		- Read(0x4000 | (CurrentSampleAddress & 0x1F)); 
	;	- But of course, in reality there is only a single read per CPU cycle.
	;	- (friendly reminder that reading from $4015 does not update the data bus)
	;
	; Anyway, if you passed [APU Register Activation],You should have a good idea at what's going on.
	; We're going to be running a series of DMA's, and syncing them all with a read from $4000, such that the data bus is changed by the DMA 1 cycle before the Open bus read.
	; Then, if the bus conflict happens, we can see that will well timed DMAs and open bus reads.
	;
	; Please don't press anything on controller 2 during this test. :)

	;;; Test 5 [Implied Dummy Reads]: Do the implied instructions have dummy reads? (They should). ;;;
	; This test extends to every error code after this.
	
	; What are we testing for here?
	; The Implied Addressing mode instructions (NOP, ASL, INX...) all have dummy reads on their second CPU cycle, reading from wherever the PC is.
	; So for instance, a NOP at address $8000 will dummy-read from address $8001. (since the PC is incremented before the second cycle)
	; pretty simple stuff, right?
	;
	; I suggest leaving it at that. You know what this test is checking for. Go forth and make those dummy reads. 
	; Trying to understand the following code is not necessary, and will drive you to madness.
	;
	; Do you even dare know how one tests for this?
	;
	; Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
	; This is without exaggeration, the most insane assembly code I have ever written.	
	
	; The idea:
	; Dummy read a read-sensitive register.
	;
	; Issue: The PPU registers have clock-alignment specific behavior changes, making the test too inconsistent. So we need to rely on the APU registers.
	;
	; The Idea take 2:
	; Dummy read $4015 to clear the Frame Counter Interrupt Flag, which will be clear when reading the next opcode.
	;
	; Issues:
	; Preparing an entire function to run inside open bus (setting up the opcode to be the instruction we want on the address we want to test) is not easy.
	; I need to sync a DMA while keeping the Frame Counter Interrupt Flag set. This DMA is used to change the data bus on the cycle after jumping to Open Bus.
	; The Frame Counter Interrupt Flag is only cleared when transitioning from a put cycle to a get cycle. (see [Frame Counter IRQ] test 6 and 7.)
	; When reading from $4015 as the opcode, bit 5 will be set if the opcode we tested had bit 5 set.
	; So making the Pass/Fail translate to a BRK/RTI will only work for half the instructions. The rest will be JSR/RTS.
	; I would *really* like it if this test did not crash in the event of failure, so I actually do need to make sure both cases are managed.
	; This means I need to manage a bunch of BRK, RTI, JSR, and RTS's, while making sure the stack pointer stays sane in the event of passing or failure.
	; If a JSR happens, the controller ports will be the operands. 
	; The controller ports have open bus in the upper 3 bits (controller 1 has 5 bits on famicom), which will leech off the value read from the opcode. (reading $4015 doesn't update the databus)

	; Okay, so what is this test actually testing for?
	; When the OAM DMA runs, the OAM DMA stalls the CPU.
	; When the OAM DMA is running and a DMC DMA also occurs:
	; The DMC DMA takes priority on get cycles, and the OAM DMA takes priority on put cycles. However, the OAM DMA will need to run an alignment cycle after the DMC DMA get.
	; However, if the DMC DMA is halted, the OAM DMA keeps going. This results in the DMC DMA appearing to only take 2 cycles.
	; [OAM put]
	; [OAM get]
	; [DMC put (Halt), OAM put] Despite the DMC DMA occurring, since it's on a halt cycle, the OAM DMA keeps going.

	; [DMC put, OAM put takes priority]
	; [DMC get] 
	; [OAM put, alignment cycle]
	; [OAM get]
	;
	; It's also worth noting, that if the DMC DMA halt cycle occurs on the OAM DMA halt cycle, both halt cycles happen at the same time.
	; And if both DMAs are halted, it's pretty much the same as a regular halt cycle, where it just reads from the current 6502 address bus,

FAIL_OAM_Corruption:
	JMP TEST_Fail

TEST_OAM_Corruption:
	; Brief synopsis:
	; If rendering is disabled during a visible scanline, OAM is going to be corrupted on the next visible pixel.
	; 8 bytes of OAM get replaced with the first 8 bytes of OAM.
	; The 8 bytes that get replaced correlate to the secondary OAM address at the moment rendering was disabled.
	; Though to complicate things, the moment rendering is disabled is "CPU/PPU Clock alignment dependent". 
	; 	- That just means this test will be more complicated for me to make, as I want the results to be consistent regardless of alignment.
	;
	; So what's going on?
	; Rendering was enabled, we're in the middle of a scanline that contains sprite evaluation (pre-render line through line 239), and rendering was disabled (no BG, no sprites).
	;	- On the first PPU cycle after rendering is enabled on a visible scanline, OAM corruption will occur. 
	;	- However, at the moment rendering was disabled, we need to know the value of the Secondary OAM Address, as that will determine exactly which bytes get "corrupted".
	;		- You can think of it as a "seed". The OAM Corruption seed will be whatever the value of the Secondary OAM Address was.
	;	- Take the current value of the Secondary OAM Address (a value from $00 to $1F) as the seed.
	;	- Wait for rendering to be enabled, and a PPU cycle to occur from the pre-render line to the end of scanline 239.
	;	- in a single ppu cycle, copy OAM[0] to OAM[Secondary OAM Address * 8]
	;	- Copy OAM[1] to OAM[Secondary OAM Address * 8 + 1]
	;	- Copy OAM[2] to OAM[Secondary OAM Address * 8 + 2] ... and this repeats through OAM[7] being copied to OAM[Secondary OAM Address * 8 + 7]
	;	- Copy SecondaryOAM[0] to SecondaryOAM[Secondary OAM Address]
	; To use the terminology, OAM Corruption corrupts a single "row" of Object Attribute Memory, where a "row" is 8 bytes.
	;	- Row 0 is OAM Address $00 to $07.
	;	- Row 1 is OAM Address $08 to $0F, and so on.
	; So if OAM corruption occurred when secondary OAM Address was a value of 'n', OAM corruption will replace OAM row 'n' with the values of OAM row 0.
	; And that's pretty much it for OAM corruption.
	;
	; Let's talk about the Secondary OAM Address in detail:
	; During cycles 1 to 64 of a visible scanline, the secondary OAM address is going to be incremented every other cycle.
	;	- cycles 1 and 2: Secondary OAM Address = $00
	;	- cycles 3 and 4: Secondary OAM Address = $01
	;	- cycles 5 and 6: Secondary OAM Address = $02
	;	- ...
	;	- cycles 61 and 62: Secondary OAM Address = $1E
	;	- cycles 63 and 64: Secondary OAM Address = $1F
	;
	; During cycles 65 to 256, sprite evaluation is occurring, and the Secondary OAM Address will be from $00 to $1F depending on how sprite evaluation goes. But to recap:
	;	- Odd cycles do not modify Secondary OAM Address, so let's focus on even cycles.
	;	- If an object's Y position is in range of this scanline, write to secondary OAM, and increment Secondary OAM Address.
	;	- Then the following even cycles will write to secondary OAM, and increment Secondary OAM Address.
	;	- NOTE: If OAM Corruption occurs between cycles 65 through 256 when the secondary OAM address is not a multiple of 4, it appears to be "ceilinged" to the nearest multiple of 4.
	;		- In other words, from cycles 65 to 256, OAM Corruption can only corrupt row 0, 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, or 28. (if Secondary OAM is full, Secondary OAM Address is $00.)
	;
	; During cycles 257 through 320, Secondary OAM Address is incremented in a pattern during an 8 ppu cycle loop.
	; On cycle 257, Secondary OAM Address is reset to 0, and then:
	;	- cycle 0 of this loop will prep the sprite Y position, and increment Secondary OAM Address
	;	- cycle 1 of this loop will prep the sprite pattern, and increment Secondary OAM Address
	;	- cycle 2 of this loop will prep the sprite attributes, and increment Secondary OAM Address
	;	- cycle 3 of this loop will prep the sprite X position, but the Secondary OAM Address is not incremented!
	;	- cycle 4 of this loop will prep the sprite X position again, but also find the VRAM address of the sprite's low byte bit plane pattern data. The Secondary OAM Address is not incremented!
	; 	- cycle 5 of this loop will prep the sprite X position again, but also set up the low byte of the pattern bit plane. The Secondary OAM Address is not incremented!
	;	- cycle 6 of this loop will prep the sprite X position again, but also find the VRAM address of the sprite's high byte bit plane pattern data. The Secondary OAM Address is not incremented!
	;	- cycle 7 of this loop will prep the sprite X position again, but also set up the high byte of the pattern bit plate. 
	;		- The Secondary OAM Address IS incremented on cycle 7 of this loop!
	;	- NOTE: If OAM Corruption occurs between cycles 257 through 320, the value of the secondary OAM address used for the corruption is different between clock alignments. Either the increment happens before / after being used.
	;	- On Alignments 0 and 3, if the secondary OAM address is 6, and this is cycle 2 of the loop (which will increment the Secondary OAM Address) the OAM Corruption will occur on row 6, not row 7.
	;	- On Alignments 1 and 2, if the secondary OAM address is 6, and this is cycle 2 of the loop (which will increment the Secondary OAM Address) the OAM Corruption will occur on row 7, not row 6.
	;
	;
	; Additional notes: OAM Corruption corrupting row 0 doesn't affect anything, since row 0 is the one that gets copied to the corrupted row. 
	;	- This also means that OAM Corruption cannot affect the outcome of a (non-arbitrary) sprite zero hit.
	; In addition to OAM becoming corrupt, I also believe the OAM address gets incremented in some situations where OAM Corruption occurs, so this test will also attempt to determine the OAM Address after the corruption occurs.

	; Things I need to test for:
	; OAM Corruption during cycles 1 to 64. (easy to do)
	; OAM Corruption during cycles 257 to 320. (easy to do as well)
	; OAM Corruption during cycles 65 to 256, with varying values of the Secondary OAM Address. (Not easy)
	;
	; I also need to make sure the results of this test are consistent regardless of the CPU / PPU Clock alignments.
	;	- So I need some sort of method to calibrate this?
	
	; Our first goal should be to calibrate the test so it works regardless of CPU/PPU clock alignments.
	; Depending on the CPU/PPU Clock alignments, the OAM corruption will occur: (at least on my console. The results are probably different on other consoles. It might be revision specific?)
	;	- Alignment 0: 2 ppu cycles after writing to $2001
	;	- Alignment 1: 3 ppu cycles after writing to $2001
	;	- Alignment 2: 3 ppu cycles after writing to $2001
	;	- Alignment 3: 2 ppu cycles after writing to $2001
	; Unfortunately, this doesn't correlate 1 to 1 with disabling rendering preventing a sprite-zero-hit.
	; That means, hilariously enough, the only way to calibrate this is to just corrupt OAM on a cycle that would either corrupt 1 row or another depending on clock alignment, and check which row it was.
	; Which of course, means your emulator needs to implement OAM corruption in order to calibrate this.
	; so that leads us to:

	; Here are all the cycles of JSR. (Simplified. JSR is actually a super odd instruction. I recommend looking at it in visual 6502 some time.)
	; 1: Read the opcode.
	; 2: Read the first operand.
	; 3: Dummy read from stack.
	; 4: Push PC High to the stack.
	; 5: Push PC Low to the stack.
	; 6: Read the second operand, and update the program counter.
	
	; This test will do the following at address $005E. JSR $4000
	; If pass, it will run RTI.
	; If fail, it will likely run RTS. (But no guarantee, since who knows how inaccurate emulation will run)	
	
	; RTI will pull off 3 bytes, [flags] [pcl] [pch]. 
	; therefore, I should push the desired high byte to the stack before the JSR.
