# AccuracyCoin
AccuracyCoin is a large collection of NES accuracy tests on a single NROM cartridge.

This ROM was designed for the RP2A03G CPU and the RP2C02G PPU. Some tests might fail on hardware with a different revision.

This ROM currently has 126 tests. These tests print "PASS" or "FAIL" on screen, and in the event of a failure, this ROM also provides an error code. In addition to those tests, this ROM also has 5 tests labeled "DRAW", which don't actually test for anything; rather, they simply print information on screen.

Here's an example of the menu in this ROM shown on an emulator failing a few tests, passing others, and a few tests on screen haven't been run yet. (The cursor is currently next to the "RAM Mirroring" test.)

# Navigating the menus
Use the D-Pad to move the cursor up or down.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing left and right will scroll to a new page of tests.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing A will run all tests on the page.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing Start will run all tests on the ROM, and then draw a table showing the results of every test.

Examples:

![Result_Table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2288e997-fca5-494e-a53d-03cbe7525353)

Any test with multiple acceptable passing behaviors will be drawn with a light blue number over it.

# The Debug Menu

After running a test, you can press "Select" to reveal this menu:

![DebugMenu_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b79c862-1eca-47f4-863d-dc2b89869188)

This menu will print several bytes on screen and can be useful for debugging certain tests in a situation where you don't have a way to view everything in RAM. I suggest simply using some form of memory viewer if possible.

This menu does not apply to every test in the ROM, as many tests don't write anything to RAM, or the values written aren't relevant for what went wrong.

The topmost row will print the values from address $20 to $2F, which are values used in the Unofficial Instruction tests.  
The second row will print the values from $50 to $6F, which are used in a handful of tests.  
The remaining 8 rows will print every byte from address $500 to $5FF, which is typically where a test will store any bytes needed for it.

Here's a color-coded version of that image, with boxes around each byte:

# Error Codes
For more information, I recommend reading the fully commented assembly code for the test.

### ROM is not Writable
  1: Writing to ROM should not overwrite the byte in ROM.  

### RAM Mirroring
  1: Reading from a 13-bit mirror of an address in RAM should have the same value as the 11-bit address.  
  2: Writing to a 13-bit mirror of an address in RAM should write to the 11-bit address.  

### PC Wraparound
  1: Executing address $FFFF should read addresses $0000 and $0001 as the operands.  

### The Decimal Flag
  1: The 6502 "Binary Coded Decimal" flag should not affect the ADC or SBC instructions on the NES.  
  2: Despite this flag not working, it still gets pushed in a PHP/BRK instruction.  

### The B Flag
  1: The B flag of the 6502 processor flags should be set by PHP.  
  2: The B flag of the 6502 processor flags should be set by BRK.  
  3: An IRQ should have occured.  
  4: The B flag of the 6502 processor flags should not be set by an IRQ.  
  5: The B flag of the 6502 processor flags should not be set by an NMI.  
  6: Bit 5 of the 6502 processor flags should be set by PHP.  
  7: Bit 5 of the 6502 processor flags should be set by BRK.  
  8: Bit 5 of the 6502 processor flags should be set by an IRQ.  
  9: Bit 5 of the 6502 processor flags should be set by an NMI.  
  
### Dummy read cycles
  1: A mirror of PPU_STATUS ($2002) should be read twice by LDA $20F2, X (where X = $10).  
  2: The dummy read should not occur if a page boundary is not crossed.  
  3: The dummy read was on an incorrect address.  
  4: The STA, X instruction should have a dummy read.  
  5: The STA, X dummy read was on an incorrect address.  
  6: LDA (Indirect), Y should not have a dummy read if a page boundary is not crossed by the Y indexing.  
  7: LDA (Indirect), Y should have a dummy read if a page boundary is crossed by the Y indexing.

  2: Read-modify-write instructions should write to $2006 twice.  
  3: Read-modify-write instructions with X indexing should write to $2006 twice.  

### Open Bus
  1: Reading from open bus is not all zeroes.  
  2: Reading from open bus with LDA Absolute should simply return the high byte of the operand.  
  3: Indexed addressing crossing a page boundary should not update the data bus to the new high byte value.  
  4: Moving the program counter to open bus should read instructions from the floating data bus values. Write cycles should update the data bus.  
  5: Dummy reads should update the data bus.  
  6: The upper 3 bits when reading from the controller should be open bus.  
  7: Reading from $4015 should not update the databus.  
  8: Writing should always update the databus, even writing to $4015.

  2: Any value with bit 0 set written to $4016 should strobe the controllers.  
  3: Controllers should be strobed when the CPU transitions from a "get" cycle to a "put" cycle.  
  4: Controllers should not be strobed when the CPU transitions from a "put" cycle to a "get" cycle.  
  
### Controller Clocking
  1: Reading $4016 more than 8 times should always result in bit 0 being set to 1.  
  2: Your emulator did not pass the SLO Absolute, X test.  
  3: (NES / AV Famicom only) Double-reading address $4016 should only clock the controller once.  
  4: (NES / AV Famicom only) This double-read should be the same value for both reads.  
  5: (NES / AV Famicom only) The "put"/"halt" cycles of the DMC DMA should be able to clock the controller if the DMA occurs during a read from $4016. The LDA instruction should clock the controller again after the DMC DMA's "get" cycle.  
  6: (NES / AV Famicom only) If the DMC DMA "get" cycle has a bus conflict with $4016, the controller will only get clocked once during LDA $4016 even with the DMC DMA occuring.  

### APU Register Activation
  1: A series of prerequisite tests failed. CPU and PPU open bus, PPU Read Buffer, DMA + Open Bus, and DMA + $2007 Read.  
  2: Reading from $4015 should clear the APU Frame Counter Interrupt flag.  
  3: The OAM DMA should not be able to read from the APU registers if $40 is written to $4016, and the CPU Address Bus is not in the range of $4000 to $401F.  
  4: Something went wrong during the open bus execution. Controller port 2 was possibly clocked too many times.  
  5: The OAM DMA should be able to read from the APU registers (and mirrors of them) if $40 is written to $4016, and the CPU Address Bus is in the range of $4000 to $401F.  
  6: Bus conflicts with the APU registers were not properly emulated.  
  7: Despite the controller registers not being visible in OAM, the controllers should still be clocked.  

### DMC DMA Bus Conflicts
  1: The DMA did not occur on the correct CPU cycle.  
  2: The DMC DMA did not correctly emulate the bus conflict with the APU registers.  
  3: The DMC DMA bus conflict should clear the APU Frame Counter Interrupt Flag.  

### DMC DMA + OAM DMA
  1: The DMC DMA timing in your emulator is off.  
  2: The overlapping DMAs did not spend the correct number of CPU cycles.  

### Explicit DMA Abort
  1: The DMC DMA timing in your emulator is off.  
  2: The aborted DMAs did not spend the correct number of CPU cycles.  
  
### Implicit DMA Abort
  1: The DMC DMA timing in your emulator is off.  
  2: The aborted DMAs did not spend the correct number of CPU cycles.  
  3: The 1-cycle DMA should not get delayed by a write cycle, rather it just shouldn't occur in that case.  
  4: If the sample was set to keep looping, the DMC DMA timing in your emulator is off.  

### PPU Reset Flag
  1: The PPU registers shouldn't be usable before the end of the first VBlank.  

### PPU Register Mirroring
  1: PPU registers should be mirrored through $3FFF.  

### PPU Register Open Bus
  1: Reading from a write-only register PPU should return the most recently written value to the PPU data bus.  
  2: All PPU Registers should update the PPU data bus when written.  
  3: Bits 0 through 4 when reading from address $2002 should read read the PPU data bus.  
  4: The PPU data bus value should decay before 1 second passes.  

### PPU Read Buffer
  1: Reading from the PPU register at $2007 is not working at all in this emulator.  
  2: Reading address $2007 should increment the "v" register.  
  3: There should be a 1-byte buffer when reading from $2007.  
  4: Reading from CHR ROM should use the buffer.  
  5: Reading from Palette RAM should NOT use the buffer.  
  6: Writing to $2006 does not modify the buffer value.  
  7: The value on the nametable at $2700 through $27FF should be put in the buffer when reading from palette RAM at $3F00 through $3FFF.  

### Palette RAM Quirks
  1: This emulator failed the PPU Read Buffer test.  
  2: Palette RAM should be mirrored through $3FFF.  
  3: The backdrop colors for palettes 1, 2, and 3 should not be mirrors of the backdrop color of palette 0.  
  4: The backdrop colors for sprites should be mirrors of the backdrop colors for backgrounds.  
  5: The values read from Palette RAM should only be 6-bit, with the upper 2 bits being PPU open bus.  

### VBlank beginning
  1: The PPU Register $2002 VBlank flag was not set at the correct PPU cycle.  

### VBlank end
  1: The PPU Register $2002 VBlank flag was not cleared at the correct PPU cycle.  

### NMI Control
  1: The NMI should not occur when disabled.  
  2: The NMI should occur at VBlank when enabled.  
  3: The NMI should occur when enabled during VBlank, if the VBlank flag is enabled.  
  4: The NMI should not occur when enabled during VBlank, if the VBlank flag is disabled.  
  5: The NMI should not occur a second time if writing $80 to $2000 when the NMI flag is already enabled.  
  6: The NMI should not occur a second time if writing $80 to $2000 when the NMI flag is already enabled, and the NMI flag was enabled going into VBlank.  
  7: The NMI should occur an additional time if you disable and then re-enable the NMI.  
  8: The NMI should occur 2 instructions after the NMI is enabled. (See Interrupt flag latency.)  

### NMI Timing
  1: The NMI did not occur on the correct PPU cycle.  

### NMI Suppression
  1: The NMI did not occur on the correct PPU cycle, or the NMI was not suppressed by a precisely timed read of address $2002.  

### NMI at VBlank end
  1: The NMI could occur too late or was disabled too early.  

### NMI disabled at VBlank
  1: The NMI could occur too late or was disabled too early.  

### Sprite 0 Hit behavior
  1: A Sprite zero hit did not occur.  
  2: Sprite zero hits should not happen if background rendering is disabled.  
  3: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite rendering is disabled.  
  4: Sprite zero hits should not happen if both sprites and background Rendering are disabled.  
  5: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is completely transparent.  
  6: Sprite zero hits should be able to happen at X=254.  
  7: Sprite zero hits should not be able to happen at X=255.  
  8: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is at X=0, and the PPU's 8 pixel mask is enabled (show BG, no sprite).  
  9: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is at X=0, and the PPU's 8 pixel mask is enabled (show sprite, no BG).  
  A: Despite the 8 pixel mask, if the sprite has visible pixels beyond the mask the sprite zero hit should occur.  
  B: Sprite zero hits should be able to happen at Y=238.  
  C: Sprite zero hits should not be able to happen at Y>=239  
  D: Your sprites are being rendered one scanline higher than they should be, or your sprite zero hit detection isn't actually checking for "solid pixels" overlapping.  
  E: The sprite zero hit flag was set too early.  

### Arbitrary Sprite zero
  1: Sprite 0 should trigger a sprite zero hit. No other sprite should.  
  2: The first processed sprite of a scanline should be treated as "sprite zero".  
  3: Misaligned OAM should be able to trigger a sprite zero hit.  

### Sprite overflow behavior
  1: Evaluating 9 sprites in a single scanline should set the Sprite Overflow Flag.  
  2: The Sprite Overflow Flag should not be the same thing as the CPU's Overflow flag.  
  3: Evaluating only 8 sprites in a single scanline should not set the Sprite Overflow Flag.  

### Misaligned OAM behavior
  1: Misaligned OAM should be able to trigger a sprite zero hit.  
  2: Misaligned OAM should stay misaligned until an object's Y position is out of the range of this scanline, at which point the OAM address is incremented by 4 and bitwise ANDed with $FC.  
  3: If Secondary OAM is full when the Y position is out of range, instead of incrementing the OAM Address by 4 and bitwise ANDing with $FC, you should instead only increment the OAM address by 5.  
  4: Misaligned OAM should realign if an object's X position is out of the range of this scanline, at which point the OAM address is incremented by 1 and bitwise ANDed with $FC.  
  5: If Secondary OAM is full when the X position is out of range, instead of incrementing the OAM Address by 1 and bitwise ANDing with $FC, you should instead only increment the OAM address by 5.  
  6: The same as test 4, but the initial OAM address was $02 instead of $01. If you see this error code, you might have a false positive on test 4.  
  7: The same as test 5, but the initial OAM address was $03 instead of $01. If you see this error code, you might have a false positive on test 5.  

### Address $2004 behavior
  1: Writes to $2004 should update OAM and increment the OAM address by 1.  
  2: Reads from $2004 should give you a value in OAM, but do not increment the OAM address.  
  3: Reads from the attribute bytes should be missing bits 2 through 5.  
  4: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 1 to 64 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should always read $FF.  
  5: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 1 to 64 of a visible scanline (with rendering disabled) should do a regular read of $2004.  
  6: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline should increment the OAM address by 4.  
  7: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline shouldn't write to OAM.  
  8: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 65 to 256 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should read from the current OAM address.  
  9: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 256 to 320 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should always read $FF.  
  A: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline should increment the OAM address by 4, and then bitwise AND the OAM address with $FC.  

### OAM Corruption
  1: This emulator failed to sync the CPU to VBlank during a test that ran when the ROM boots.  
  2: OAM Corruption should "corrupt" a row in OAM by copying the 8 values from row 0 to another row.  
  3: This corruption should not occur immediately after disabling rendering.  
  4: This corruption should now occur immediately after re-enabling rendering.  
  
### INC $4014
  1: The DMC DMA should update the data bus.
  2: The OAM DMA should use the value of the second write to $4014 as the page number. Requires precise DMC DMA timing, results are tested via a sprite zero hit.
  3: Only a single OAM DMA should occur despite two writes to $4014.
  
### RMW $2007 Extra Write
  1: A Read-Modify-Write instruction to address $2007 should perform an extra write where the low byte of the PPU address written is the result of the Read-Modify-Write instruction.  
  2: This extra write should not occur when "v" is pointing to Palette RAM. (An extra write still might occur, but that's not the one we're testing for.)  
  3: If "v" is pointing to Palette RAM, this extra write should not get written to the nametable.  

### Instruction Timing
  1: The DMA should update the data bus.  
  2: The DMA timing is not accurate enough to test this.  
  3: The immediate addressed instructions should take 2 CPU cycles.  
  4: The zero page addressing mode for non-read-modify-write instructions should take 3 cycles.  
  5: The zero page addressing mode for read-modify-write instructions should take 5 cycles.  
  6: The indexed zero page addressing mode for non-read-modify-write instructions should take 4 cycles.  
  7: The indexed zero page addressing mode for read-modify-write instructions should take 6 cycles.  
  8: The absolute addressing mode for non-read-modify-write instructions should take 4 cycles.  
  9: The absolute addressing mode for read-modify-write instructions should take 6 cycles.  
  A: The indexed absolute addressing mode for STA instructions should always take 5 cycles.  
  B: The indexed absolute addressing mode for many instructions should take an extra cycle if the page boundary was crossed.  
  C: The indexed absolute addressing mode for read-modify-write instructions should always take 7 cycles.  
  D: The indirect, X instructions should always take 6 cycles (well, except for the unofficial ones).  
  E: The indirect, Y instructions should take an extra cycle if a page boundary is crossed.  
  F: The implied instructions should take 2 cycles.  
  G: PHP should take 3 cycles.  
  H: PHA should take 3 cycles.  
  I: PLP should take 4 cycles.  
  J: PLA should take 4 cycles.  
  K: JMP should take 3 cycles.  
  L: JSR should take 6 cycles.  
  M: RTS should take 6 cycles.  
  N: RTI should take 6 cycles.  
  O: BRK should take 7 cycles.  
  P: JMP (indirect) should take 5 cycles.

  2: Your emulator did not implement the frame counter interrupt flag properly.  
  3: Your emulator did not update the data bus when the DMC DMA occured, or your DMA timing is off.  
  4: Your emulator did not correctly emulate open bus behavior. (Or if your emulator crashes here, the cycles of JSR are in the wrong order.)  
  5: ASL A should perform a dummy read on cycle 2. (The PC was incremented after reading the opcode in the previous cycle, so these dummy reads should occur from the new location of the PC.)  
  6: CLC should perform a dummy read on cycle 2.  
  7: LSR A should perform a dummy read on cycle 2.  
  8: CLI should perform a dummy read on cycle 2.

### JSR Edge Cases
  1: Your emulator pushed the wrong value for the return address.  
  2: Your emulator has incorrect open bus emulation.  
  3: JSR should leave the value of the second operand on the data bus.  

# Success Codes
