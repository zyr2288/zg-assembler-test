# NES-Pong-6502-Assembly-
A minimalist Pong clone for the Nintendo Entertainment System, written entirely in 6502 assembly. Player 1 uses the NES controller to control the left paddle, while a simple AI controls the right paddle.

# Features

Written from scratch in pure 6502 assembly.

Player 1: Up/Down on the NES D-Pad.

Simple but effective AI opponent.

Score display for both players (resets after a win).

Collision detection for paddles, ball, and walls.

Center dashed line drawn using background tiles.

Fully functional NES .nes ROM with proper iNES header.

# Code Overview

Header & Vectors – Proper iNES header and interrupt vectors.

Zero Page Variables – Ball position, paddle positions, velocities, scores, etc.

Game Loop – Runs every NMI, updating logic and rendering.

Paddle AI – Simple "follow the ball" logic with a dead zone.

Collision Detection – Handles paddle hits, wall bounces, and scoring.

CHR Tiles – Ball, paddles, center line, and number sprites embedded in ROM.

# Controls

Use a NES Controller 

You can also use a Emulator (like Mesen, which I used) 
https://www.mesen.ca

# Compiling

Compile with a 6502 Assembly Compiler like NESASM or CA65 

Compiler Commands for CA65 (which I used) https://cc65.github.io/

./ca65 game.asm -o game.o
./ld65 -C nes.cfg game.o -o game.nes

# Fun Fact

The NES’s PPU renders backgrounds and sprites separately, so the center dashed line is drawn in the background layer, while paddles and ball are sprites. Quick Side Note the current AI used is not going to let you win ;)
